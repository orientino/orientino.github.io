I am a first year PhD student in the [Security and Trust of Software Systems](https://satoss.uni.lu/) group at the [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/). My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning with topics as distribution shift, uncertainty estimation, robustness and privacy risks. I am interested in both the theoretical results and the practical applications to fields such as, but not limited to, healthcare and medicine.

Born in China and raised in Italy, I received my education at the [University of Pisa](https://di.unipi.it/) in Computer Science. During the last year of my studies, I collaborated with the [DAML](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/home/) group in Munich and interned at [Amazon Music](https://music.amazon.com/) in Berlin. Feel free to contact me for anything! :)
